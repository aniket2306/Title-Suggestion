For the past 50 years, the National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program has played a key role in developing new and improved cancer therapies and preventive strategies. NCI-sponsored trials have studied distinct cancer subpopulations and those with rare cancers, elucidated the role of therapeutic and chemoprevention agents such as tamoxifen for breast cancer, and evaluated quality-of-life issues for patients with cancer. But a new report from the Institute of Medicine IOM of the National Academies concludes that the Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program is in a state  crisis.The IOM report recommends 12 sweeping changes in the ways that their clinical trials are reviewed, prioritized, and funded-changes that are likely to affect players as diverse as NCI and the FDA, clinical research investigators, cancer patients, and even heath-care insurers and the pharmaceutical industry. More than 25,000 cancer patients, 3,100 institutions, and 14,000 investigators from cancer centers and community oncology practices participate in Cooperative Group clinical trials each year-and they would all likely be affected by the IOM’s recommended changes.Many people involved in the Cooperative Group clinical trials, including NCI and those doing research in the academic community and practice community, shared the same frustrations. The Cooperative Group trials system had become inefficient and slow, and we were not adequately funding and incentivizing people to participate-including patients and physicians, said John Mendelsohn, MD, Chair of the IOM committee and President of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. There was too much recycling of efforts, and too much gathering of opinions and counteropinions to design the trials. Everything needed to be streamlined.
